# Aims
The purpose of a TechiesBattle app is to provide consumers with a convenient and user-friendly mobile
platform for online shopping.
# Objectives
• Delivering Wholesome Cuisine at a Reasonable Price
• To create a system that will unquestionably please customer service.
• To design a system capable of handling multiple orders simultaneously.
• To enhance communication between the client and server and reduce the ordering time.
• To manage the details of item gadgets, address, etc.
# Project Background
Popular electronics such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets necessitate a user-friendly web purchasing
site. Offering a wide selection, detailed product information, and secure mobile payment choices, a gadget
ecommerce app simplifies buying. Tech-savvy device shoppers use ecommerce apps. Millennials and
younger shoppers prefer mobile ease and efficiency. The gadget ecommerce app's aims are to increase sales
and revenue by providing a user-friendly and efficient shopping experience, improving customer
engagement and loyalty, expanding the customer base, and building brand awareness. Amazon, Best Buy,
and Newegg vie in gadget ecommerce apps. To thrive, the app needs better user experience, personalized
recommendations, exclusive discounts and promotions, and great customer support. A smooth and secure
checkout would build faith.
# Design
## Architecture (Repository pattern)
TechiesBattle mobile apps commonly use the storage pattern. The design separates the application's
business code and data access layer. This simplifies and lowers the codebase. The repository provides data
processes between the app and the data storage mechanism. Repository design isolates the data access layer,
simplifying code upkeep. Developers can change the app's data store or database without affecting business
logic. The repository pattern helps create application unit tests by allowing the repository to be mocked or
changed during testing. The repository pattern's separation of duties allows the TechiesBattle mobile app
to scale to high data and user volumes. Finally, repository design improves m-commerce app efficiency,
scaling, and maintainability.

# Data and Security
## Cloud Computing
Retail mobile apps need cloud computing. Cloud computing lends retail mobile apps scalability, freedom,
and cost-effectiveness. Cloud-based retail mobile apps grow. Cloud tech adapts apps to users. The app
handles traffic spikes without failing or slowing down, keeping customers buying. Cloud tech frees retail
mobile apps. Cloud tech simplifies app feature development. Store mobile apps can afford cloud computing.
Cloud services lower company equipment and maintenance costs. Apps can replace company system
control. Finally, cloud computing improves shop mobile app security. Security, multi-factor authentication,
and IDS/IPS safeguard cloud data. Retail mobile apps need cloud computing. Scalability, flexibility, costeffectiveness, and enhanced security help businesses build apps that meet user needs while controlling
costs.
## Data Handling
### Local data
Numerous benefits can be gained by integrating ObjectBox into a device shipment software. To begin,
unlike conventional SQLite databases, ObjectBox's data access times are optimized from the ground up to
be lightning rapid. Thus, the app is able to rapidly retrieve data from the local database, enhancing both
performance and the user experience. Second, ObjectBox's straightforward API makes it easy for
developers to access and modify data, making it a natural fit for use in a gadget delivery app. This facilitates
the development of the app by removing the need for complex database management duties. Thirdly,
ObjectBox allows for automated data synchronization, which allows for the local database to be updated in
tandem with the server database without any manual intervention. This guarantees that information is
always up-to-date and correct, even when the user is not connected to the internet.(Shelke et al., 2017)
### Remote data
ObjectBox is a device-local storage. By synchronizing local and online databases, ObjectBox can save
remote data in a gadget delivery app. Data is regularly retrieved from the remote server and updated in the
local ObjectBox database during synchronization. HTTP APIs, websockets, and Firebase Cloud Messaging
can do this (FCM). ObjectBox remote data storing is fast. ObjectBox is fast and effective, so data access
times are faster than SQLite. This can help gadget delivery apps handle large amounts of data in real time.
ObjectBox is easy to use for remote data storing. ObjectBox integrates easily with other technologies and
frameworks due to its basic API. ObjectBox also offers automatic data syncing, which simplifies custom
synchronization. With synchronization, ObjectBox can store remote data in a device delivery app.
Developers of high-performance retail apps can use its speed and ease of use. (Morales Savoca et al., 2021)
# Methodology and Tools
## Agile
Agile helps ecommerce apps meet user wants and keep up with fast-paced business. Agile jobs have oneto-four-week cycles. Sprints deliver working, proven product increments with high-priority features and
needs. TechiesBattle apps may start with design, technology, user stories, and product backlog. Searching,
viewing, and buying may be in the second sprint. User input and testing could add product ratings or wish
lists to the third sprint. The fourth sprint may speed up and scale the app and add any leftover features or
powers from earlier sprints. Fifth run tested, fixed, and released app. Daily stand-ups discussed sprint aims,
successes, and challenges. Each cycle, the crew reviewed successes, failures, and improvements. Breaking
development into smaller, manageable chunks helps ecommerce app developers avoid scope creep and
produce a high-quality product on time and on budget.
## Tools
I use various tools to make an Techies Battle app, depending on my needs.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A famous code editor for Techies Battle website development. Syntax
marking, debugging, and code completion simplify coding.
Flutter: Flutter builds mobile and web apps. It lets you create gorgeous, high-performance UIs quickly.
Node.js: Node.js runs JS code outside of a web browser. It builds server-side apps and Techies Battle
websites with payment handling and user authentication.
Git: This version control system lets you log code changes and collaborate with others. It manages shopping
and other web application codes.
